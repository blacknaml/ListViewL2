    <!-- Changelog -->
    <string name="activity_settings_changelog_popup_text">*Completely new base logic. If anything doesn\'t work as expected, please contact us at android@shortcutlabs.com\n\n*WeMo reinserted\n\n*Supported apps. More applications will come soon..\n\n*New category overview\n\n<b>1.5.4</b>\n\n*New action: Runkeeper.\n\n*WeMo temporarily removed.\n\nSorry for a small update. Something BIG is coming soon..\n\n<b>1.5.3</b>\n\n *Added Configs in the provider-view. A user can now set a predefined set on actions and load this anytime he/she wants.\n\n*Added a new action called \"Change Config\". May be clear what this action does.\n\n*Added the possibility to temporarily inactivate providers. Since we often use third party SDK\'s, we can\'t guarantee that they work as they should.\n\n*Added a new Action - Bluetooth Control - that lets you toggle a connection to a known Bluetooth device.\n\n*The actions in the action-overview are now draggable. Hold one action down for a second and you can move it around.\n\n*Added the possibility to hide all your disconnected Flics in the main view for a better Flic overview.\n\n*The camera now works behind locked screen.\n\n*Added graphics in the action overview to let our users see what happens in the application when you press the Flic.\n\n*The IFTTT-action now supports tags. This gives our IFTTT-users more options.\n\n<b>1.5.0</b>\n\n*A fix to the Tasker plugin that might break your Tasker configurations.\n\n*Improved battery life. Some users will notice a great change.\n\n*The emails sent from help &amp; feedback are now redirected to the entire android team due to a high amount of mails sent right now. The developers personally take care of all these mail since we find them very important. So keep sending them!\n\n*Fixed a bug where the Flicservice randomly started even tho you exited the application. (Thanks Julius)\n\n*I guess you all noted that all your configurations disappeared in the previous version. All bad things bring something good. We found a nasty bug in our synchronizing algorithm. That is now fixed. And from now on, we won\'t touch your configurations again :).\n\n*Added GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) so we can reach you guys if we have something important to tell. This will not be abused.\n\n*Fixed a visual bug where the footer of the search wizard wasn\'n shown on some devices.\n\n*Continued to fix crashes (we rarely get any at this point. If you find stability issues that doesn\'t generate crashes, please write to us at android@shortcutlabs.com).\n\n*Improved the camera action. A better one will come later.\n\n*Added the option to hide/show your Flics that are not in range. (Thanks Tomer)\n\n<b>1.4.8</b>\n\n*Added this fancy changelog button (thanks Tomer). A very good idea since Play Store doesn\'t allow more than 500 characters. And we thought that you might be interested in what we are up to. We would like your feedback even here. Maybe this changelog is too long/short?\n\n*Removed a visual bug that didn\'t show any status indicator in the main Flic overview screen.\n\n*Fixed the crashes that were reported.\n\n*Removed \"Hour\" from the delay field (who is using that?) when configuring an action, and added milliseconds. Could thank Tomer on this one as well, but I take the honor here.\n\n*Added a \"Rate us\"-prompt (that shouldn\'t be too annoying).\n\n*Finally replaced our error sound, that a few of you might have heard by now. (Thanks Jonathan)\n\n*Improved the Flic click counter. The number of clicks are now stored in the Flic, instead of in the application.\n\n*Shazam action now work with both the free and premium version of the app. (Thanks Hendrik)\n\n*Fixed a bug where the error prompt was shown even when successfully synchronizing Flics to a new device\n\n*LIFX no longer clears/refreshes the devices when you switch network. (Thanks Troy)\n\n*Improved the network switch listener. This will improve all the actions using LAN. (Thanks again Troy)\n\n*Various of other small bug fixes.\n\nThanks to everyone for reporting (and even crashing the app). More features will come. Stay tuned.</string>

To achieve this:\n\n1. Turn off Bluetooth on the device that is already connected to your Flic\n2. Make sure that Flic pulses in red when you click it.\n3. Press and hold down Flic for at least 7 seconds.\n4. Connect Flic to the other device and configure it\'s settings on that device.\n\nFlic will now operate on the device it is currently connected to.

To avoid that other devices, that you might not even know, listens for your Flic. Flic will be paired with one device and only send information to this one device. That also means that two devices can\'t listen for one button at the same time.\n\nHowever, you can share the Flic with other devices. This basically means that the Flic will trigger the function(s) on the first of its paired devices it finds. To find out how to do this, please read the \"Share\"-section.</string>

   <string name="activity_help_and_feedback_how_many_flics_text">This variates some depending on what device you are running. On most Android-devices, you can connect up to 8 Flics to one device. This number is in most cases not a hardware limit. Instead is it just set in different devices to make sure that the signals don\'t interfere. Also, the number is increasing continuously.</string>

    <string name="activity_help_and_feedback_access_item">Access a Flic that you had connected to another device</string>
   <string name="activity_help_and_feedback_access_text"><i>This depends on if you are trying to access the Flic from the same Flic-account or not.</i> \n\nIf you are trying to connect it to <b>the same</b> account again on a different device, your Flic needs to whitelist the new device. Basically telling the Flic to trust this device as well. To do this you need to hold down the Flic for <i>7</i> seconds while it is not connected to another device. The Flic should blink and then slowly fade out during this time. When this is done it will be ready to connect to the next device it finds.\n\nIf you are trying to connect it to <b>another</b> account, the Flic backend will reject this request since you are not the owner of the button. You hereby have two choices. Either the owner removes the button from his/her account, telling the Flic backend that it is no longer in his/hers possession The other option is to simply log in into the owners account and share the button to the Flic account of the person wanting to use it. Read more under the \"Share\"-section.</string>

    <string name="activity_help_and_feedback_range_item">What is the range of my Flics?</string>
   <string name="activity_help_and_feedback_range_text">In open spaces, the range is around 30 to 50 meters. But this can variate greatly depending on how the (if there are any) walls are formed, other interfering devices, items that block the signals and a lot of other stuff. To find out what range the Flic has in the environment where you are going to use it, the best way is to simply test for yourself. If the Flic is reliably connected, you found a good spot to place the Flic.</string>

Thanks to our backer Jordan for the following information.\n\n<b>1.</b> Go to our Flic app -> providers -> Sonos and find all your speakers. We don\'t get any information about the names of the speakers so you have to insert this name yourself to be able to distinguish them. Maybe make an action with the speaker, and see what speaker in real life it triggers.\n\n<b>2.</b> Go to your Sonos app where all your speakers are listed. Here you should see a button called \"GROUP\" on each of the speakers. Press this button and remember what speaker you grouped on. Now add all the speakers you want to be toggled in this group.\n\n<b>3.</b> In the Sonos action in the Flic app - only trigger the speaker that was the original member of the group. Now when you trigger this action, all the Sonos speaker included in this group should be affected.</string>

Either my developers removed it in a later version, since they found it obsolete or it is a new function that arrived in a later version of this application that you don\'t have. If it was shared from another operating system, my developers have been to lazy to give it to me yet or maybe it was not possible to program it.</string>
